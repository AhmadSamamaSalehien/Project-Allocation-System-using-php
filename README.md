Student Project Allocation System in PHP

Overview

The Student Project Allocation System is a web-based application designed to streamline the process of allocating projects and supervisors to students in universities and colleges. It replaces manual record-keeping with an efficient, internet-based system that supports CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations, making it user-friendly and ideal for beginners learning web development with databases.

Existing System

The current manual system involves maintaining student and project information in physical registers, which is time-consuming and error-prone. Accessing data requires searching through multiple registers, increasing the risk of misplacing or losing information due to poor organization and storage.

Proposed System

The proposed Student Project Allocation System is a web-based solution that enables institutes to store and access student and project information efficiently from any location. By entering a student’s ID or name, administrators can retrieve comprehensive details, including academic records, addresses, and contact information. The system also supports automated testing, result generation, and ranking, allowing students to check their results and class ranks easily.

Features

Centralized Data Management: Stores student, project, and user information in a single database.
Accessible Anywhere: Internet-based system for easy data retrieval.
Automated Testing: Conducts tests and generates lists of students who pass.
Result and Rank Access: Students can view their results and class ranks.
User-Friendly Interface: Simple navigation for both admins and users.

Modules

Admin Module

System Control: Managed by the institute administrator.
User Management: Assigns IDs and passwords to authorized personnel.
Access Tracking: Logs system access with date and time for accountability.
Data Management: Performs CRUD operations on student, project, and supervisor data.

User Module

Secure Access: Users log in with a unique ID to view details.
Read-Only Access: Limited to viewing information without edit capabilities.

Technology Stack
Front End

HTML: Structures web documents (e.g., created using Notepad/Notepad++).
CSS: Designs attractive layouts with Cascading Style Sheets.
Bootstrap: Ensures responsive, mobile-friendly design.
JavaScript: Enhances interactivity on web browsers.

Back End

PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor for dynamic web page generation, open-source.
MySQL: Database for querying, updating, and managing data.
